# 0x02. Responsive design

## Description
Making a responsive website is not easy. Much like designing an accessible website, developers and designers donâ€™t have a set recipe to follow, and each website can implement its own layout depending of the client screen.

This project is designed to help learn the basic concepts of responsive design as well as techniques such as Viewport, media queries and firebox
